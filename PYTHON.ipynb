        "Python is a programming language idealized in the early '80s and developed in the early '90s by a Dutch researcher named Guido van Rossum, to be more exact in December 1989. The reason why this programming language was developed was Due to the dissatisfaction he felt when working with the ABC programming language (general-purpose imperative programming language and programming environment, used in the CWI research center, where Guido worked) in the project that was entrusted to him. Guido, realizing the limitations and problems encountered when working with the ABC language, decided to create a programming language that would overcome all those limitations, that is where Python would emerge."
